My name is Idris Abdulmumin, a Postdoctoral Fellow of the [Data Science for Social Impact Research Group](https://dsfsi.github.io/) at the [University of Pretoria](https://www.up.ac.za/), under the supervision of [Professor Vukosi Marivate](https://www.up.ac.za/computer-science/view/staffprofile/36101). I am also a lecturer at the Department of Computer Science, [Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria](https://abu.edu.ng/), Nigeria. I obtained my PhD in August 2023 under the supervision of [Professor Bashir Shehu Galadanci](https://fci.buk.edu.ng/node/128) at [Bayero University Kano](https://buk.edu.ng/), Nigeria. My doctoral research focused on enhancing machine translation systems for low resource languages by harnessing the power of monolingual data.

During my doctoral and postdoctoral journey, I had the privilege of extensive collaboration with fellow researchers, expanding my horizons. My involvement in organizations like [Masakhane](https://www.masakhane.io/), [HausaNLP](https://github.com/hausanlp), and [LITHME](https://lithme.eu/) broadened my insights into the global NLP community, fueling innovation. I've led impactful projects, organized events, curated datasets, and spearheaded initiatives, all dedicated to advancing NLP for African languages. As a postdoctoral fellow, I'm excited to embark on a new challenge of creating resource-efficient language models, with a focus on African languages. I aim to contribute to inclusive NLP research by developing accessible models tailored to the African community.
